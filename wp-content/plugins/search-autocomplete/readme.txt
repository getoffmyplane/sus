== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Download the plugin from the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search-autocomplete/">Wordpress repository</a>
2. Upload `search-autocomplete` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. {Optional} If you want to add aditional themes to the settings, create the theme with the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/">jQuery UI ThemeRoller</a> and upload the resulting "/css/" directory to the "/css/" of this plugins installed directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I just modify the existing theme files rather than upload new jQuery UI Themes? =

Yes, but it's recommended that you create a copy of the theme that you are going to modify rather than directly editing it.  Future releases of this plugin may overwrite your changes if they are made to default theme files.

Please <a href="http://hereswhatidid.com/contact/">contact the author</a> for support. Thanks!
